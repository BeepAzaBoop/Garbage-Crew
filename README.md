# Smart Waste Sorter — Trash, Compost & Recycling Classifier

This project is an **AI-powered automated waste sorting system** that classifies waste items into **Trash**, **Compost**, or **Recycling** categories using a fine-tuned image classification model.

The system is deployed on a **Raspberry Pi** integrated with a **LEGO Mindstorms EV3** controller that operates a **motorized trapdoor mechanism**. This mechanism physically directs waste items into the correct bin based on AI predictions. The project showcases a practical application of **AI combined with robotics** to improve sorting efficiency, reduce contamination in waste streams, and enable scalable, real-world implementations.

## System Workflow

1. The Raspberry Pi camera captures live video frames of incoming waste items.
2. If enabled, YOLOv11n detects bounding boxes around individual objects for focused classification.
3. Each detected crop (or the full frame if YOLO is disabled) is preprocessed and fed into the MobileNetV3 classification model.
4. The model predicts the waste category for each object.
5. Based on classification, the Raspberry Pi sends commands to the EV3 brick to actuate the corresponding trapdoor motor.
6. The trapdoor mechanism physically sorts the item into the designated bin (Trash, Compost, or Recycling).
7. Optional snapshot mode allows pausing live feed to review and debug classifications.

## Model Optimization and Deployment

-   Models can be run in full precision or quantized modes; quantization significantly reduces model size and increases inference speed on CPUs with minimal accuracy loss.
-   The MobileNetV3 model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset tailored for waste classification and exported as a TorchScript module for efficient deployment.
-   Quantized models leverage PyTorch’s native quantization API and are scripted via TorchScript to enable seamless JIT compilation.
-   Multi-threading settings are adjusted dynamically to optimize CPU usage on Raspberry Pi.
